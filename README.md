## My Tasks

this on-the-job-ticket was given to me, with starter code that needed Refactoring. My task was to go in and make the code more stable and was met to a certain standard. I had to change all of the div elements to the correct criteria, such as changing all of the divs to sections and articles. i also needed to make the code more organized and easier to navigate.
